This repository contains multiple-choice questions (MCQs) on TypeScript interfaces, inheritance (extends), and implementation (implements). It covers key concepts such as:

Interfaces: Defining object structures
Extending Interfaces (extends): Inheriting properties and methods
Implementing Interfaces (implements): Enforcing class structure
Readonly properties: Preventing modifications
Optional properties (?): Allowing flexible object definitions
Interface members: Properties and methods in interfaces
This repo is a great resource for learning TypeScript concepts through MCQs
